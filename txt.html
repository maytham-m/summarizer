<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:172.92px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">good thing, I think it's asking a huge question about our model...our operating model and how</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:231.02px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">forward?</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:260.33px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">And I think the other thing that comes to mind is the whole ‘fly-in/fly-out’ and travel situation, at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:274.73px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">least for the short term but maybe deeper than that.  We start to wonder, is this sustainable as a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:289.61px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">model?  Not only because of the difficulties and challenges of traveling; Working, or having an</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:318.43px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Does it work having your family away from you?  And particularly if you're going to be stuck and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:332.86px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">not being able to travel - is that sustainable?  Do we need to rethink our whole model of where</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:362.14px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">I think there are some fundamental questions that are being raised, that we’re starting to think</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:536.98px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">The first point that you said is about knowing where our people are...and you said that that was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:551.38px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">non-existent, effectively.  And clearly there's an issue that so what mechanism or message or</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:565.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">attempt do we have currently, to know where people are, if any?</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:624.38px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">they book through the official system...trouble is though, that they might change flights… So,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:653.18px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">know which flight anybody actually took. And then, we don't really track people via hotels so We</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:668.09px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">don't really know and then there's a bunch of people who don’t book via the official system so</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:72.05px;top:638.78px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">it’s come up and people have been forthcoming to talk about it.  I think, in the Middle East, It's</span></div>
